# machine_learning_project
# Project Overview: 
Machine learning project where I use Python to predict whether an object is a Rock or Mine based on SONAR data. This project leverages a Logistic Regression model to classify objects and showcases practical applications of data science and machine learning techniques.
# Project Details:
Objective: Build a predictive model to differentiate between Rocks and Mines using SONAR data.
Model: Logistic Regression
Data: SONAR dataset containing features extracted from SONAR scans
Environment: Google Colaboratory
